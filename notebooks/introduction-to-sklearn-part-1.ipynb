We will then use hyper-parameter tuning to improve the performance of our shortlisted models to arrive at an overall best model.

Example: suppose that the current solution for predicting the price of a house in a given census block is to ignore all the demographic information and predict a simple average of house prices in nearby census blocks. In this case it would probably not make sense to start building a complicated deep learning model to predict housing prices.

As such now is a good to to discuss the Scikit-Learn application programming interface (API). The [Scikit-Learn API](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) is one of the best designed API's around and has heavily influenced API design choices of other libraries in the Python Data Science and Machine Learning ecosystem, in particular [Dask](https://dask.org/) and [NVIDIA RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/). Familiarly with the Scikit-Learn API will make it easier for you to get started with these libraries.\n",

        "The Scikit-Learn API is built around the following key concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Estimators: Any object that can estimate some parameters based on a dataset is called an estimator (e.g., an `preprocessing.MinMaxScaler` is an estimator). The estimation itself is performed by the `fit` method, and it takes only a dataset as a parameter (or two for supervised learning algorithms; the second dataset contains the labels). Any other parameter needed to guide the estimation process is considered a hyperparameter (such as the `feature_range` parameter in `preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`), and it must be set as an instance variable (generally via a constructor parameter).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Transformers: Some estimators (such as an `preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`) can also transform a dataset; these are called transformers. Once again, the API is simple: the transformation is performed by the transform method with the dataset to transform as a parameter. It returns the transformed dataset. This transformation generally relies on the learned parameters. All transformers also have a convenience method called `fit_transform` that is equivalent to calling `fit` and then `transform` (but sometimes `fit_transform` is optimized and runs much faster).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Predictors: Finally, some estimators, given a dataset, are capable of making predictions; they are called predictors. A predictor has a `predict` method that takes a dataset of new instances and returns a dataset of corresponding predictions. It also has a score method that measures the quality of the predictions, given a test set (and the corresponding labels, in the case of supervised learning algorithms).\n",
        "\n",
        "All of an estimator’s hyperparameters are accessible directly via public instance variables (e.g., `preprocessor.feature_range`), and all the estimator’s learned parameters are accessible via public instance variables with an underscore suffix (e.g., `preprocessor.scale_`). Finally, Scikit-Learn provides reasonable default values for most parameters which makes it easy to quickly create a baseline working system."

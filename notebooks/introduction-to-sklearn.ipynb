Today we will mostly focus on classical machine learning algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn; tomorrow we will revist the same problem using deep learning algorithms implemented in PyTorch. By the time you have finished this two-day workshop you should understand how to build a machine learning application capable of classifying images and be ready to apply what you have learned to a new dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This morning we will mostly focus on getting the data and exploring the data to gain new insights. Believe it or not these initial steps are what data scientists and machine learning engineers spend the majority of their time doing! This afternoon we will prepare our data for machine learning, see how to fit a variety of machine learning models to our dataset and shortlist a few candidate models for further analysis. We will then use hyper-parameter tuning to improve the performance of our shortlisted models to arrive at an overall best model. We will finish with a discussion of how to present the results of your model and talk about some of the aspects of deploying a trained model to make predictions.\n",

Knowing the overall objective is important because it will determine your choice of machine learning algorithms to train, your measure(s) of model performance, and how much time you will spend tweaking the hyper-parameters of your model.\n",

    "In our example today, the overall business/research objective is to make money from serving targeted ads to users of a social media application based on the images that they post.

Note that the current \"best\" solution could be very simple or could be very sophisticated. Understanding the current solution helps you think of a good place to start. Example: suppose that the current solution for predicting the price of a house in a given census block is to ignore all the demographic information and predict a simple average of house prices in nearby census blocks. In this case it would probably not make sense to start building a complicated deep learning model to predict housing prices. However, if the current solution was a tuned gradient boosted machine then it probably would not make sense to try a much simpler linear regression model.\n",

If our problem is a classification task are we trying to classify samples into 2 categories (binary classification) or more than 2 (multi-class classification) categories?

    "The `preprocessing.MinMaxScaler` and the `preprocessing.StandardScaler` classes are the first Scikit-Learn `Transformer` classes that we have encountered. As such now is a good to to discuss the Scikit-Learn application programming interface (API). The [Scikit-Learn API](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) is one of the best designed API's around and has heavily influenced API design choices of other libraries in the Python Data Science and Machine Learning ecosystem, in particular [Dask](https://dask.org/) and [NVIDIA RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/). Familiarly with the Scikit-Learn API will make it easier for you to get started with these libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scikit-Learn API is built around the following key concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Estimators: Any object that can estimate some parameters based on a dataset is called an estimator (e.g., an `preprocessing.MinMaxScaler` is an estimator). The estimation itself is performed by the `fit` method, and it takes only a dataset as a parameter (or two for supervised learning algorithms; the second dataset contains the labels). Any other parameter needed to guide the estimation process is considered a hyperparameter (such as the `feature_range` parameter in `preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`), and it must be set as an instance variable (generally via a constructor parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transformers: Some estimators (such as an `preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`) can also transform a dataset; these are called transformers. Once again, the API is simple: the transformation is performed by the transform method with the dataset to transform as a parameter. It returns the transformed dataset. This transformation generally relies on the learned parameters. All transformers also have a convenience method called `fit_transform` that is equivalent to calling `fit` and then `transform` (but sometimes `fit_transform` is optimized and runs much faster).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predictors: Finally, some estimators, given a dataset, are capable of making predictions; they are called predictors. A predictor has a `predict` method that takes a dataset of new instances and returns a dataset of corresponding predictions. It also has a score method that measures the quality of the predictions, given a test set (and the corresponding labels, in the case of supervised learning algorithms).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of an estimator’s hyperparameters are accessible directly via public instance variables (e.g., `preprocessor.feature_range`), and all the estimator’s learned parameters are accessible via public instance variables with an underscore suffix (e.g., `preprocessor.scale_`). Finally, Scikit-Learn provides reasonable default values for most parameters which makes it easy to quickly create a baseline working system."

    "\n",
    "* Feature selection: selecting the best subset of features for training. \n",
    "* Feature extraction: combining existing features to produce new features for training.\n",
    "* Feature creation: finding additional data sources to use as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is often the most labor intensive part of building a machine learning pipeline and often requires extensive expertise/domain knowledge relevant to the problem at hand. Recently packages such as [featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com/) have been developed to (partially) automate the process of feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of deep learning in various domains is in significant part due to the fact that deep learning models are able to automatically engineer features that are most useful for solving certain machine learning tasks. In effect deep learning replaces the expensive to acquire expertise/domain knowledge required to hand-engineer predictive features. \n",
    "\n",
    "A recent example that demonstrates that power of automated feature engineering is [Space2vec](https://medium.com/dessa-news/space-2-vec-fd900f5566), a deep learning based supernovae classifier developed by machine learning engineers with no expertise in Astronomy that was able to outperform the machine learning solution developed by NERSC scientists. The machine learning pipeline developed by NERSC scientists, called [AUTOSCAN](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/dessn/autoscan/), was a significant improvement over the previous solution which relied on manual classification of supernovae by astronomers. However, in order to achieve such high accuracy, the NERSC solution relied on a dataset of hand-engineered features developed by astronomers with over a century of combined training and expertise in the domain. The deep learning algorithm used by space2vec could be applied directly to the raw image data and did not rely on any hand-engineered features."

    "The grid search approach is fine when you are exploring relatively few combinations but when the hyperparameter search space is large it is often preferable to use [`model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV) instead. Instead of trying out all possible combinations, `model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV` evaluates a given number of random combinations by selecting a random value for each hyperparameter at every iteration. This approach has two main benefits.\n",
